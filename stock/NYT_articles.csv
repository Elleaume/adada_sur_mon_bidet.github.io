Last month he released ''An Other Cup'' (Atlantic), his first album of pop songs in 28 years. This week, after arriving in the United States on Sunday, he chose radio broadcasts for his first performances here since the 1970s. They included a Sirius satellite radio show to be aired first at noon today and, on Tuesday night, a concert-with-interview for the public radio station KCRW at Jazz at Lincoln Center's Allen Room.      During his onstage interview with KCRW's music director, Nic Harcourt -- to be broadcast and webcast at 2:15 p.m. Thursday at www.kcrw.org -- Mr. Islam revealed that his return to pop might have happened sooner. In 2004, he was turned away when he tried to enter the United States because his name was on the no-fly list created to fight terrorism. With that London-to-Washington trip, Mr. Islam said on Tuesday, he was headed for Nashville, where he had booked recording sessions and musicians. The deportation led to official protests from the foreign office of Great Britain, where Mr. Islam is a citizen and has spoken repeatedly against terrorism. He was allowed into the United States this time without incident. Visiting the United States now, he said onstage, was, ''One small step for a man, one giant step for common sense.'' One of his new songs, ''Maybe There's a World,'' envisions, ''an open world, borderless and wide/Where the people move from place to place and nobody's taking sides.''
