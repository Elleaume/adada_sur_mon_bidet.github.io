                    To be (a terrorist) or not to be? GTD Definition of Terrorism and Inclusion Criteria. The GTD defines a terrorist attack as the threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non-state actor to attain a political, economic, religious, or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation. In practice this means in order to consider an incident for inclusion in the GTD, all three of the following attributes must be present: <br/>
                    <li>The incident must be intentional – the result of a conscious calculation on the part of a perpetrator. </li>
                    <li>The incident must entail some level of violence or immediate threat of violence -including property violence, as well as violence against people. </li>
                    <li>The perpetrators of the incidents must be sub-national actors. </li> <br/>

                    The database does not include acts of state terrorism. In addition, at least two of the following three criteria must be present for an incident to be included in the GTD: <br/>
                    <li>criterion1: The act must be aimed at attaining a political, economic, religious, or social goal. In terms of economic goals, the exclusive pursuit of profit does not satisfy this criterion. It must involve the pursuit of more profound, systemic economic change.</li>
                    <li>criterion2: There must be evidence of an intention to coerce, intimidate, or convey some other message to a larger audience (or audiences) than the immediate victims. It is the act taken as a totality that is considered, irrespective if every individual involved in carrying out the act was aware of this intention. As long as any of the planners or decision-makers behind the attack intended to coerce, intimidate or publicize, the intentionality criterion is met.</li> 
                    <li>criterion3: The action must be outside the context of legitimate warfare activities. That is, the act must be outside the parameters permitted by international humanitarian law, insofar as it targets non-combatants. </li>

                    <iframe width = '1000' height = '800' frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="img/CountAttacks.html"></iframe>

                    <div class="text-corps">
                     This graph generally shows an increase of number of attacks over the past 50 years. We can also see that the data scraped in attempt to complete the events from 1993 is not comparable to the number of events recorded for the other years. Specific norms for data collection are absent before 1997, therefore, we will focus on the years 1997-2017 for the following analysis. The trend in the early 2000’s was relatively low, which may come as a surprise as this is when terrorism became a hot topic. Between 2013-2017, the number of attacks have decreased. This could partially be due to change in legislative regulations. But is this a global trend?

                    <h4 class = "section-subheading"> <br/> Casualties per year<br/>  </h4>
                    <iframe width = '1000' height = '550' frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="img/CasualtiesPerYearSub.html"></iframe>

                    <div class="text-corps">
                      The number of casualties seem to follow the same trend as the number of attacks, except for 2001, where we have an important peak in deaths and wounded victims. This peak relates to the 9/11 terror attacks, we can see that in terms of damage either related to human casualties or property, this was one of the major events in the decennia. However, in more recent events, the total number of casualties almost doubled in comparison to the memorable event of 9/11. <br/>
                      The plot on the right depicts the magnitude of violence of the terror attacks by normalizing the amount of casualties to the number of attacks. The peaks clearly depict the single deadliest terrorist acts. Interestingly, after 2008 the number of casualties per attack seemed to decrease. We could hypothesize that this reflects the consequences of counter-terrorism or that the terrorist’s tactics have evolved. Very large scale attacks such as 9/11 are probably not as easy to reproduce anymore due to the increased security in the air traffic. On top of that, most countries that are not actively involved in conflicts have given more importance to foreign defence.

                      Concerning property damage, we can clearly see a peak in 2001, representing the destruction of the World Trade Center in New York and its surroundings. The destruction of the Twin Towers, in terms of physical goods, is the largest damage that any terror group has achieved so far. When combining the material loss and huge human death toll, 9/11 still is the most traumatic event of these last 20 years. We can note that in 2014 and 2016, the normalised property damage is lower than the total count. This implies that the number of attacks in those years is the reason for the peak in damage, and that it is not necessarily due to the severity of the attacks. Concerning the other years,  normalisation of the property damage according to the number of attacks does not result in a significantly different distribution.

                      Since 2004, the country with the highest number of casualties is clearly Iraq, rapidly followed by Afghanistan and Pakistan. Middle East is the theatre of a large variety of complex conflicts, in particular during these last few years. Religion, ethnic, political and ideological conflicts are still ongoing in the Middle East. It may be interesting to keep in mind that USA was involved in most of these conflicts and wars... We can see that some African countries are also in very instable political situations, such as Nigeria and Somalia, from 2011 onwards.

                    <h4 class = "section-subheading"> <br/> Most active groups of terrorists in the world <br/>  </h4>
                    <iframe width = '1000' height = '800' frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="img/MostActiveGroups.html"></iframe>

                    <div class="text-corps">
                      We chose to plot the 30 most active terrorist groups in terms of number of attacks. <br/>
                      As mentioned previously, the groups that are the most active are located in the Middle East with the Talibans in Afghanistan and Pakistan, ISIL in Iraq and other countries in the Levant region, Al-Shabaab in Somalia, Boko Haram in Nigeria and the neighbouring countries. In the recent years, the most active terrorist organisations are radical Islamist groups.  <br/>
                      There are a few groups that are being very active, and have committed several thousands of terror attacks. These groups, are large structured organisations, they have the fire power to rivalise with local order forces.  

                    </div>

                    <h4 class = "section-subheading"> <br/> Most targetted types by active groups of terrorists<br/>  </h4>
                    <iframe width = '1000' height = '800' frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="img/MostActiveTarget.html"></iframe>

                    <div class="text-corps">
                      We can see that each group has a slightly different distribution of targets. Civilians are the primary targets of most groups, this being consistent with most groups strategic practices. Nevertheless, the targets of the most active groups are mainly directed towards governmental institutions. This could be interpreted as a protest against the established government, which they are trying to disrupt in order to gain in power. Instability in a countries order gives leanway to these large organisations to spread their message and ideologies. 

                    </div>

                    <h4 class = "section-subheading"> <br/> Targets <br/>  </h4>
                    <iframe width = '1000' height = '800' frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="img/SubTargets.html"></iframe>

                    <div class="text-corps">
                      If we dive into the individual types of targets, many subcategories can be investigated. Interestingly, we can see that civilians are the primary victims of terrorists followed by the police, military and government. In all categories, primary targets still are individual peoples rather than properties, this indicates that terrorists aim not to disrupt pure communication or material supply of the countries they target, which would be one of the most classical war strategies to weaken governments and countries. We hypothesize that the strategy of targeting individuals has the aim to shock and traumatize populations as the aim is not necessarily to target a specific subtype of people, but generate as many casualties as possible. The fact that “random” civilians are likely to be the general targets induces fear among the general population. Fear is their way of communicating ideological views of the groups in question and is what gives terrorism its social and ultimately political punch.<br/>
                      Main forces that act against terrorists are also largely targeted. The Police and Military are classes of people that may be the most directly related to counter-terrorism and prevent a country from sinking into chaos. They are important forces in a country’s organisation.

                    <div class="text-corps">
                      We would have expected each group to use different weapons depending on how easy the access to some resources is. But even here, the most popular weapons for most groups are explosives and firearms. This seems to make sense as we saw that targeting civilians at random and wanting to induce a large amount of damage is key. It is possible that the black market is responsible for the weapons to reach the groups in areas where resources are limited. Palestinian Extremists surprisingly have to resort to use melees as weapons, this might mean that the blockage of the Gaza strip might actually prevent firearm traficants to reach Palestine and they resort to less sophisticated weapons. <br/>

                      This figure represents the repartition of the 100 most active groups per continent in a logarithmic scale. As we can see, the most active groups are in Asia, indeed that confirms what was seen previously in the Middle-East. Africa is also one of the continents where groups are most active, again this is consistent with was we saw previously. Thanks to this graph and the one of most active terrorist group in the world will enable us to generate the following map of the predominant groups per continent. This also allows us to establish that the magnitude of the attacks are not comparable among the different continents as the scale of activity is so different. The top “terrorist group” in Asia has committed over 7000 attacks, while the top North American group committed only around 60.

                      The names of the different groups active on a certain continent are represented, have their size increasing proportionally to the contribution they bring to the total activity of the terrorist attacks of their continent. The size is only relevant within the own continent, and cannot be compared between continents! It might be interesting to note that terror groups within North America or Europe are not necessarily what one generally might imagine when one thinks of typical “terrorism”.

                      Using the articles database, we attributed to each article a terrorism score based on word content: words related to the terrorism semantic field. We also selected a handful of other topics and built a word map using these topics. We can now see the most represented topics in American articles appearing in relation to articles treating terrorism. Government, war and politics are topics relatively important in the articles. This could indicate that in the articles selected, the focus on the context of conflicts the general background/ political motives and situation is elaborated. They do not seem to focus on sentimental impacts of terror but rather on more factual information. However we may need further analysis of much more data to assert this.

To take another look at the topics and themes of articles about terrorism, we built a radar plot with the scores of articles on a variety of themes to depict the angle with which terrorism appears  in the different continents. We still see the same trend as in the word map, but some differences seem to emerge among the continents. Politics and government seem more important for articles about terrorism in Europe and North America. Overall, the predominant themes emerging from this plot seem to be : government, crime and war. It is difficult to observe general temporal trends, but we can see that in more recent years, from 2010 to 2017, war is an important topic linked with Asia.
