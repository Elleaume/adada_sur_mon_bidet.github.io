                        Since September 11, 2001, terrorism has been in the headlines around the globe. A general fear reappears every few years as events labelled as "terrorist attacks" occur. Certain parties have gained in popularity in the past few years, often using the anxiety of "dangerous terrorists" as a pretext to defend anti-immigrant policies. Have terrorist attacks increased in the past years as we are led to believe? or has the rate been more or less constant? Who commits these attacks and what population is the real target? News coverage plays a big role in how we perceive these events, some events are debated and discussed during weeks, while others are never mentioned. We want to explore the rate and distribution of these attacks over the world, and dive into their news coverage in the western hemisphere. What themes are covered in parallel to the articles linked to terrorism? We will investigate what groups are considered “active terrorist” groups around the globe and the magnitude of their attacks and their damage.

                    Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is a collection of facts about terrorist attacks from 1970-2017. The facts cover location, date, motive, and who claimed the attack and a very large variety of other very specific metrics. GTD was built by a multidisciplinary team of University of Maryland faculty members and contains a large variety of structured variables characterizing each attack’s location, tactics and weapons, targets, perpetrators, casualties and consequences and general information such as definitional critera and links between coordinated attacks. Event from 1993 were scraped from Wikipedia, as they were missing in the initial dataset.</div>

                    All the news is a collection of news coverage from CNN, New York Times, Breitbart, Fox news, the Guardian.
                    New York Times articles was used to complete the dataset of articles collected from “all the news” as this was a rather narrow dataset. 
                    For the article selection concerning terrorism, a score was built by scanning the general bodies for an overlap with the dictionary of “terrorism” in spacy. They were then also scored on various other topics, and if terrorism was among the top 3 scores, the article was retained. Articles with general low scores were also removed.
